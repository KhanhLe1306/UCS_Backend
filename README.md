## About

In short, our application is meant to be an automatic and manual way to edit the college of IS&T at UNO. We created an algorithm that can sort through courses and find an optimal position for it based on a number of criteria. We also have the capabilities to manually interact with courses as well whenever someone wants to add, remove, or edit something about a course. This includes adding an entirely new class to the schedule, removing a class from the schedule, changing the room a class is in, changing the time a class takes place, changing the instructor teaching the class, and adding a new instructor to be used when adding or editing classes. Our application also allows the schedulers to upload the current schedule being used as a CSV, make their changes, then download the updated schedule as a CSV. This is a web application that utilizes a database to store the information in the schedule so that changes can be persistent for all users editing the schedule.

## Release Notes

Manual class adding, removal, editing. Adding Instructors works, searching by room number and instructor name also works. Logging in does not work, signing up does not work, automated scheduling does not work. Code is not deployed to any webserver either, everything was ran locally.

## Branch Info

The master/main branch has all of our up to date code. The other branches show a breakdown of work by each team member through out the semester and are there if you want to look at them but no other branches have any unfinished features or experimental code.
